Introduction
============l

Like other erlbots, this erlbot is an irc bot I wrote to help me learn Erlang. The plugin system makes it easy to add functionality. 

It is currently hard coded to connect to localhost:6667 and join #erlang and #bots.

Design Notes
=============

bot_conn - Manages the socket connection.
irc_router - Event manager which parses incoming irc messages and notifies subscribers with easy to filter events
plugin_sup - Plugin supervisor.  Define plugins to load in here.  You can add plugins and load them without restarting the bot.
